When creating a directory using the terminal, make sure you initialize your project directory before you create any files. If not, all files from your desktop will be pushed into your repository. That was a learning experience that I discovered along my journey.

ex.

cd desktop/project_folder

---

Next run the following command...

>git init

This will initialize an individual repository for you project folder.
